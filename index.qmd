1. **Numerical vs Categorical Encoding:** Zip codes can be modelled as numerical or categorical variables. Given what you know about zip codes and real estate prices, how should zip code be modelled, numerically or categorically?  Is zipcode an ordinal or non-ordinal variable?

**Answer:**


2. **R vs Python Implementation Differences:** When modelling zip code as a categorical variable, the output tree and feature importance would differ quite significantly had you used R as opposed to Python. Investigate why this is the case.  What does R offer that Python does not? Which language would you say does a better job of modelling zip code as a categorical variable? Can you quote the documentation at [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) suggesting a weakness in the Python implementation? If so, please provide a quote from the documentation.

3. **Are There Any Suggestions for Implementing Decision Trees in Python With Prioper Categorical Handling?** Please poke around the Internet (AI is not as helpful with new libraries) for suggestions on how to implement decision trees in Python with better (i.e. not one-hot encoding) categorical handling.  Please provide a link to the source and a quote from the source.  There is not right answer here, but please provide a thoughtful answer, I am curious to see what you find.
